python-ucam-webauth-raven-compat (1:0.9.0) bionic; urgency=medium

  Our raven Python package is now named ucam_webauth.raven; the corresponding
  Debian/Ubuntu package has also been renamed to python3-ucam-webauth /
  python-ucam-webauth.  Code will need updating to use the new Python package.

  This package exists to aid upgrades from python-raven to python-ucam-webauth
  by providing an alias for the package with its old name.

  However, another -- completely unrelated -- package called python-raven /
  python3-raven is now present in the Debian and Ubuntu archives.  The two
  different python-raven packages cannot coexist.  This package deliberately
  takes precedence over the official one in order to avoid breaking code
  during upgrades.

  Having the python-raven Apt repository in your /etc/apt/sources.list*
  WILL BREAK any other package that depends on the other python-raven package!

  You should migrate your code to python-ucam-webauth as soon as possible,
  and remove python*-raven AND DECONFIGURE the python-raven Apt repository.

  A new Apt repository is available which just contains python*-ucam-webauth
  without this dangerous compatibility wrapper.
